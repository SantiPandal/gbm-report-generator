	M&A ECM and DCM Market Overview - Mexico	Fibra Next completed its IPO in July 2025 raising MXN 8000 million the largest public offering in Mexico in over six years	32 M&A transactions completed in 2025 highlighting Pinfra's sale of Altamira Port for over USD 800 million	The Return of Large Offerings to the BMV	Javier Gayol	Head of Investment Banking GBM		The successful placement of Fibra Next with 8000 million pesos raised (~USD 431 million) not only marks the largest public offering in Mexico in over six years but also sends a clear signal: the Mexican capital market has appetite and capacity for large-scale operations when attractive assets and solid structures are presented. Fibra Next's industrial portfolio together with a well-defined growth strategy managed to capture the interest of national and international investors in an environment where IPOs had practically disappeared. Beyond the amount raised this IPO could become a catalyst for other companies to consider going public reactivating the flow of new issuances and returning prominence to the Mexican Stock Exchange on the global capital radar. If it manages to consolidate its expansion plan and generate competitive returns Fibra Next will not only be remembered for its size but for having reignited the engine of placements in Mexico.
